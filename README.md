## WildHeart Zookeeper Profile App

This app was created as a portfolio project while going through Flatiron's Software Development Course. It is a proof of concept/brainstorming for a future build to be used by the WildHeart Foundation.

## Description

Zookeepers will create an account, where they are then able to add simple profiles for the animals they work with. They can create a collection of toys that each
animal is able to receive.
In the final build, this page will include a container that displays an animal and some of its profile information. Also displayed will be a toy that visitors can choose
to donate towards, with a progress bar showing how much is left to go (typically under $50-$100 total). Once the item is fully funded, that item is order and shipped to the animal.

A new animal is then selected to be displayed along with the toy it will be receiving and the process begins again.
